The LSST Overview paper provides a short summary of the four primary science drivers, as well as the expected performance of LSST in terms of throughputs, and calibration. It also discusses high-level survey constraints and tradeoffs. Last updated in 2018 (but a living doc- ument that will have future incremental updates), this is available as http://ls.st/pif

The LSST Science Book tackles an in-depth view of a broad range of LSST science goals. Writ- ten in 2009 by the LSST Science Collaborations, each chapter focuses on investigations rele- vant to a different area of astronomy. Available at https://www.lsst.org/scientists/scibook

The Community Observing Strategy Evaluation Paper (COSEP) is a community-driven paper describing a wide variety of science cases and their implications for survey strategy. This paper is primarily aimed at helping define the main wide-fast-deep survey. Last updated in 2017, the analysis in the COSEP is currently based on older simulations (including a refer- ence simulation similar to the current baseline, but with significant differences in the detailed observations). The COSEP will continue to be a living document, with periodic updates as provided by authors. This is available as http://ls.st/3y1

The LSST Science Requirements Document (SRD) describes the official requirements for LSST science deliverables. Section 3.4 is the most relevant for survey strategy, although other sec- tions are relevant for telescope and camera performance such as throughputs and readout time. This document is under change control, and is not subject to update. Available as http://ls.st/srd

The LSST Data Products Definition Document (DPDD) describes the data products that LSST will provide, with some high-level background on how they will be produced. If you want to know what will be contained in various catalogs, this is a good place to look. Available as http://ls.st/dpdd

The LSST Data Management Science Pipelines Design (LDM-151) document describes the

The LSST data management processing pipelines. This provides details of how and when images will be processed and catalogs will be generated, including information on the algorithms used in each processing stage. If you want to know more about the details of a value in an output catalog and how it will be calculated, this is the place to look. This document will be pe- riodically updated as processing algorithms are improved. Available as http://ls.st/ldm-151

Documentation about the LSTS Operations Simulator (OpSim), which consists of the Simu- lated Observatory Control System and Scheduler, including a high-level overview and descrip- tion of scheduling options, is available at http://sims-opsim.lsst.io.

The 2018 baseline simulated survey document describes the recent, post-COSEP, features enabled in OpSim, as well as characteristics of the updated baseline simulated survey. This documents is available at http://ls.st/od6.

Documentation about the LSST Metrics Analysis Framework (MAF), including a high-level overview and descriptions of current standard metric analyses, is available at http://sims-maf.lsst.io.

The outputs of MAF analyses for the 2018a baseline survey, as well as runs demonstrating potential options for mini surveys and Deep Drilling fields (a subset of the runs described in Chapter 2 of the COSEP) are available online at http://astro-lsst-01.astro.washington.edu: 8080.

A short description of the current Deep Drilling fields and links to further materials (including white papers submitted in response to the 2011 call for input on the DD strategy) are available on the LSST website at http://ls.st/57q. Additional posts on LSST Community can be found by searching for ‘deep drilling’.
