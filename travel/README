Travel Expenses for the TVS Workshop
====================================

Please complete the spreadsheet travel_expenses_form.xlsx.

Note that there are two tabs to complete:
Tab 1: Travel summary
Tab 2: Per diem

The US government's per diem rate for the Bethlehem, PA region has been filled in already, so 
please indicate the dates for which you attended the meeting.  Per diem is calculated at 75% of this 
rate for days where you were traveling to and from the meeting, and 100% for those days where
you were at the meeting.

If you have any questions, please contact Rachel Street, rstreet@lco.global
